Install neoism first - see the GSY GitHub wiki page: https://github.com/SouthendDevs/gsy/wiki/Neo4j-Go:-Neoism-library

Compile and run go programs with go run: 

$ go run program.go

tomHanksFilms.go: Requires the films and actors database running on localhost:7474. You will have to edit the file with your neo4j password and comment out the panic line that tells you to input your password.

junctionQuery.go: This connects to our remote server, you will have to get the password from the Slack and edit the PASSWORD const. With that done it should just work.
