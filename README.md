Go Simulate Yourself

Ingram and Andy K suggest everyone use only spaces for indentation - 2 spaces per indent. You can set your editor to write tabs out to spaces, or find-replace tab characters "\t"  with two spaces.

We are using TDD for this project.

Also, have a look at the stuff in the notes folder, and the GitHub wiki pages.
