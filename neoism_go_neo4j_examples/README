Compile and run go programs with go run: 

$ go run program.go

tomHanksFilms.go: Requires the films and actors database running on localhost:7474. You will have to edit the file with your neo4j password and comment out the panic line that tells you to input your password.

junctionQuery.go: This connects to our remote server, it should just work providing you have neoism installed (see the GSY github wiki).
